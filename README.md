banking system in sholder surfing attack

ABSTRACT:
Graphical password is one of technic for authentication of computer security. The most crucial aspect of computer science nowadays is digital/computer security, which protects user or customer data. And one of the hazards is shoulder-surfing, in which a criminal can acquire a password by watching directly or by recording the authentication session. There are a number of methods for this authentication, but the most popular and straightforward is the graphic password method. A bank is essential to people's daily lives. The bank's top priority is the security of its customers. To safeguard user accounts, the authentication process must be secure. Textual passwords are a frequently used method. The system uses the graphical password to demonstrate the banking website's security in order to offer a possible substitute for the traditional alphanumeric password techniques to prevent shoulder surfing techniques.







CHAPTER-1

INTRODUCTION

One method for computer system authentication is a graphic password. Our digital devices are created in a safe space thanks to computer security. One method for ensuring the security of a digital device or vital information is the use of a graphic password. We all know that an image or an image-based password is easily stored or recalled by the human brain. Therefore, we suggest graphical passwords for users who can record random values with high levels of security and have no trouble remembering them. It employs various kinds of shapes and images as a password, as the name would imply. Scientists also assert that an image is easier for the human brain to recall than text. Images are easily processed by the human brain. So Graphical password authentication system implement with bank system, Bank has an important role in providing secure transactions to the customers and maintaining their details in a confidential manner. Each bank has their own constraints to secure client details and transactions that are both online and offline. Authentication is usually the first step encountered by users for a security-focused system. Authentication plays a vital role as it determines whether the user can be granted access to a particular system or not. 
The most common way of authentication is alphanumerical passwords which have been used for decades. In addition, conventional passwords have significant security issues, due to the difficult combination of keys (which includes uppercase, especial characters and numbers).  Alphanumeric passwords are a dated, conventional, and popular type of authentication. Practically speaking, the typical approach is an unsafe system. For instance, if a user is not using a strong password, the attacker may pick an easily guessable password. For numerous devices or websites, a user may use the same password. All of these characteristics make regular users vulnerable. And one of the key security points where the user actively assumes responsibility for the security of their personal information is during authentication.
The system is user friendly by making it easier for user such that it is not necessary to remember any sequence of items. The proposed system is not vulnerable to traditional attacks such as shoulder surfing, dictionary attacks, spyware attacks and guessing attacks. Details of the customer are maintained confidentially by graphical password technique. The system is less vulnerable to brute force and shoulder surfing attacks compared to traditional system.

One limitation of graphical passwords is that they are vulnerable to shoulder surfing attack. In this paper a novel scheme for entering the click points on images without allowing shoulder surfing attacks is proposed. An android implementation of the proposed scheme was used to verify the usability and security of the proposed scheme.
Graphical password:
A graphical password or graphical user authentication is a form of authentication using images rather than letters, digits, or special characters. The type of images used and the ways in which users interact with them vary between implementations. With increasing technical advancements the world is becoming digital at a high pace and everything is happening online. From paying your bills to ticket bookings to paying the person sitting next to you, you prefer to pay online. Not only payments but all activities be it, communication through e-mails and messaging apps, keeping your documents in a digital locker, etc happen online. With everything turning online, the risk of cybercrimes and privacy breaches is also increasing. Passwords play a huge role in keeping your data safe online as well as offline platforms. Passwords are the default method of authentication to get access to our accounts.

MODULE DESCRIPTION:
Registration with graphical password:
In a graphical password authentication system, the user has to select from images, in a specific order, presented to them in a graphical user interface (GUI). According to a study, the human brain has a greater capability of remembering what they see (pictures) rather than alphanumeric characters.
Login with graphical password:
Web Based Graphical Password Authentication System is a web based application that can be used in any system to allow users to sign up and log in using a different model other than the static passwords. In normal authentication systems, static passwords are used by users to get in the system but it is a known fact that static passwords are very easy to hack. Thus in this system, a user can select certain points in an image and use them as their password. They are immune to basic hacking techniques like brute force attack & dictionary attacks.
Deposit or withdraw:
Deposit is money put into a bank account for safekeeping until you need it. A withdrawal is money that's taken out of your account.


Account to account transfer:
The authentication must be secured in order to protect user accounts. The common technique which is used is textual password.User can transfer money to one account to another user account with graphical password authentication system.
Admin Management: 
Administrator is a set of individuals that administer the applicant/Affiliate entity. For example, Accountants, Authorized Signatories for organizations, Power of Attorney for individuals. To onboard and manage users and their login credentials for channel banking access.

DOMAIN OF THE PROJECT
PYTHON:
Python is an interpreter, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding; make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.It ranges from simple automation tasks to gaming, web development, and even complex enterprise systems. These are the areas where this technology is still the king with no or little competence: Machine learning as it has a plethora of libraries implementing machine learning algorithms. Python is a one-stop shop and relatively easy to learn, thus quite popular now. What other reasons exist for such universal popularity of this programming language and what companies have leveraged its opportunities to the max? Let’s talk about that. Python technology is quite popular among programmers, but the practice shows that business owners are also Python development believers and for good reason. Software developers love it for its straightforward syntax and reputation as one of the easiest programming languages to learn. Business owners or CTOs appreciate the fact that there’s a framework for pretty much anything – from web apps to machine learning. Moreover, it is not just a language but more a technology platform that has come together through a gigantic collaboration from thousands of individual professional developers forming a huge and peculiar community of aficionados. So what is python used for and what are the tangible benefits the language brings to those who decided to use it? Below we’re going to discover that. Productivity and Speed It is a widespread theory within development circles that developing Python applications is approximately up to 10 times faster than developing the same application in Java or C/C++. The impressive benefit in terms of time saving can be explained by the clean object-oriented design, enhanced process control capabilities, and strong integration and text processing capacities. Moreover, its own unit testing framework contributes substantially to its speed and productivity.
